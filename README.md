# PlateUp-Package-Manager

PlateUp Package Manager is designed to make PlateUp modding much easier with the ability for third parties to setup repositories that you're able to pull mods from!

PlateUp Package Manager natively supports MelonLoader based mods, although can also work with BepInEx based mods, although won't have any error checking for them.
